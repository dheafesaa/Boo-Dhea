This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Development Time

I spent a total of 4 hours on this project, starting at 7:20 AM and finishing at 11:20 AM as required.

## Scope of Work

✅ Completed
Finished slicing the dashboard UI, including its core functionalities.
Implemented responsive layout and interactive elements based on the design.
Ensured smooth navigation and basic user interactions on the dashboard page.

⏸️ Skipped
Creating a new comment feature.
Several small UI details and micro-interactions that were not essential for the main flow.

🚀 If I Had More Time
With additional time, I would focus on polishing the user experience—adding subtle animations, improving component modularity, enhancing accessibility, and refining UI details to create a more delightful interface. I’d also complete the comment feature and integrate better validation and error states to make the dashboard feel more robust and production-ready.
